# InfoLib

A library for calculating information theory quantities for discrete variables.

### hist

Standard functions based on probability distribution estimated by the histogram method that counts the occurence frequency as probability. These functions are not computational fast, but convenient for calling them.

### fastHist

Fast functions based on probability distribution estimated by the histogram method. These functions require data is integer vector and values should be greater than 0 (>=1).
